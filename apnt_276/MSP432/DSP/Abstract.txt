This DSP example demonstrates the TI MSP432 LaunchPad eval board with ARM CMSIS-DSP libraries
See www.arm.com/cmsis

Serial Wire Viewer is used to graphically display the four global variables.
SWV Core Clock is 48 Mhz.

This example creates a sine wave with noise added, and then the noise is filtered out.
The waveform in each step is displayed in the Logic Analyzer using Serial Wire Viewer and the Watch window.
The four global variables are  sine, noise, disturbed and filtered.

This example incorporates Keil RTX RTOS.  RTX is available free with a BSD license.  RTX Source code is provided.
Two Kernel Awareness Viewers are part of Keil uVision.
