The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for 
the TI MSP432' microcontroller using LaunchPad 
Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v4.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:  =           48.00 MHz


Serial Wire Viewer (SWV) Core Clock is 48 MHz.

This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which simulates
the step-motor driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating
the activation of the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

 CMSIS-DAP - for on-board TI emulator (Onboard XDS-110ET)
 ULINK2 - Keil ULINK2
 ULINKpro - for use with Keil ULINKpro
 J-Link - for Segger J-Link
